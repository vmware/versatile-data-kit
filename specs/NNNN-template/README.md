# VEP-NNNN: Your short, descriptive title

* **Author(s):** Name (mail), ...
* **Status:** draft | implementable | implemented | rejected | withdrawn | replaced


To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Create an issue in Github (if one does not exists already)**
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the specs directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) created above.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  There are instructions as HTML comments.
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
- [ ] **Create a PR for this VEP.**
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the VEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

## Summary

<!--
Short summary of the proposal. It will be used as user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a (customer facing) development roadmap.
The tone and content of the `Summary` section should be
useful for a wide audience.
-->

## Glossary
<!--
Optional section which defines terms and abbreviations used in the rest of the document.
-->

## Motivation
<!--
It tells **why** do we need X?
Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.
Explain the user problem that need to be solved.
-->

## Requirements and goals
<!--
It tells **what** is it trying to achieve?
List the specific goals (functional and nonfunctional requirements)? How will we
know that this has succeeded?

Specify non-goals. Clearly, the list of non-goals can't be exhaustive.
Non-goals are only features, which a contributor can reasonably assume were a goal.
One example is features that were cut during scoping.
-->

## High-level design

<!--
All the rest sections tell **how** are we solving it?

This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?

Provide a valid UML Component diagram that focuses on the architecture changes
implementing the feature. For more details on how to write UML Component Spec -
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_diagram#External_links.

For every new component on the diagram, explain which goals does it solve.
In this context, a component is any separate software process.

-->


## API design

<!--

Describe the changes and additions to the public API (if there are any).

For all API changes:

Include Swagger URL for HTTP APIs, no matter if the API is RESTful or RPC-like.
PyDoc/Javadoc (or similar) for Python/Java changes.
Explain how does the system handle API violations.
-->


## Detailed design
<!--
Dig deeper into each component. The section can be as long or as short as necessary.
Consider at least the below topics but you do not need to cover those that are not applicable.

### Capacity Estimation and Constraints
    * Cost of data path: CPU cost per-IO, memory footprint, network footprint.
    * Cost of control plane including cost of APIs, expected timeliness from layers above.
### Availability.
    * For example - is it tolerant to failures, What happens when the service stops working
### Performance.
    * Consider performance of data operations for different types of workloads.
       Consider performance of control operations
    * Consider performance under steady state as well under various pathological scenarios,
       e.g., different failure cases, partitioning, recovery.
    * Performance scalability along different dimensions,
       e.g. #objects, network properties (latency, bandwidth), number of data jobs, processed/ingested data, etc.
### Database data model changes
### Telemetry and monitoring changes (new metrics).
### Configuration changes.
### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy (especially if it might be breaking change).
  * Data migration plan (it needs to be automated or avoided - we should not require user manual actions.)
### Troubleshooting
  * What are possible failure modes.
    * Detection: How can it be detected via metrics?
    * Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    * Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
    * Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why._
### Operability
  * What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the system.
  * What are the expected SLOs (Service Level Objectives).
### Test Plan
  * Unit tests are expected. But are end to end test necessary. Do we need to extend vdk-heartbeat ?
  * Are there changes in CICD necessary
### Dependencies
  * On what services the feature depends on ? Are there new (external) dependencies added?
### Security and Permissions
  How is access control handled?
  * Is encryption in transport supported and how is it implemented?
  * What data is sensitive within these components? How is this data secured?
      * In-transit?
      * At rest?
      * Is it logged?
  * What secrets are needed by the components? How are these secrets secured and attained?

## Implementation stories
<!--
Optionally, describe what are the implementation stories (eventually we'd create github issues out of them).
-->

## Alternatives
<!--
Optionally, describe what alternatives has been considered.
Keep it short - if needed link to more detailed research document.
