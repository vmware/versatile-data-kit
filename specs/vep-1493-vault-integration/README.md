## Summary

Provide integration with Hashicorp Vault for secure storage of secrets. Control Service operators will be able to
optionally configure a vault instance to be used for storing data job properties which are marked as secret.

## Glossary

CS or VDK-CS - The Versatile Data Kit [Control Service](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/tree/main/projects/control-service)
[Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) or Vault - A tool for secrets management, encryption as a service,
and privileged access management
Secret/Secrets - sensitive data which needs to be available to data jobs - including but no limited to: secrets/
passwords/credentials/tokens/data

## Motivation

* Some data jobs need to use secrets in order to connect to third party systems by providing user credentials or tokens -
currently these secrets are stored in data jobs properties, which in turn are stored in plain text in the configured Control
Service Database. This enhancement will allow users to securely store secrets/passwords/credentials/tokens/data into a vault.
* Compliance: Storing sensitive information such as credentials, tokens, or API keys in plaintext may lead to
non-compliance with certain industry standards or regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA. Without it, VDK would be hard to be
certified to store or process restricted type of data.
* Risk reduction: Storing secrets in plaintext increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
This is severely mitigated by services like Vault .


## Requirements and goals

Goals:
* provide the ability to optionally configure a Vault instance in the Control Service for storing secrets
* change the APIs and SDK so that users can set and retrieve secrets and data jobs can use them during runtime

Non-Goals:
* automatic provisioning of a Vault instance as part of the VDK-CS installation
* automatic migration of existing secrets to Vault

## High-level design

In order to implement the proposed change, we should make the following changes - highlighted in the diagram below:
* provide the ability to optionally configure a Vault instance in the Control Service for storing secrets
* change the CS to store properties marked as secret into the configured Vault
* enhance vdk cli to allow for users to store secrets for their data jobs
* during runtime, data jobs can retrieve/store/update the secrets

## API design

Currently, data job properties are stored and read in bulk. We are going to introduce similar APIs for storing and
reading secrets.

#### Storing/retrieving secrets Control Service API

Introduce new API methods for storing and retrieving secrets under:
[/data-jobs/for-team/{team_name}/jobs/{job_name}/deployments/{deployment_id}/secrets]()

```yaml
...
    Secrets:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/DataJobSecrets'
      description: Data Job properties


...
    DataJobSecrets:
      description: Secrets of a Data Job
      type: object
      additionalProperties:
        type: object
      example:
        redshift-user: foo
        redshift-password: bar
...

  '/data-jobs/for-team/{team_name}/jobs/{job_name}/deployments/{deployment_id}/secrets':
    summary: |
      Data Job Secrets API.
    get:
      tags:
        - Data Jobs Secrets
      responses:
        '200':
          $ref: '#/components/responses/Secrets'
      operationId: dataJobSecretsRead
      summary: Get Data Job secrets.
      description: <i>(Introduced in v1.0)</i>
    put:
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/DataJobSecrets'
        required: true
      tags:
        - Data Jobs Secrets
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Created successfully.
        '204':
          description: Updated successfully.
      operationId: dataJobSecretsUpdate
      summary: Update Data Job secrets.
      description: <i>(Introduced in v1.0)</i>
    parameters:
      -  name: team_name
         description: Team Name
         schema:
           type: string
         in: path
         required: true
      - name: job_name
        description: Data Job Name.
        schema:
          type: string
        in: path
        required: true
      - name: deployment_id
        description: Data job deployment id.
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/DataJobDeploymentId'
        in: path
        required: true
```

When storing secrets, the request body is expected to provide a JSON object, containing all secrets:

```json
{
  "secret1": "secret_value1",
  "secret2": "secret_value2",
  "secret3": "secret_value3"
}
```

#### Storing/retrieving secrets via the SDK during data job runtime

We are going to introduce Secrets API similar to the existing Properties API in the
[JobInput class](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/blob/main/projects/vdk-core/src/vdk/api/job_input.py#L11)
which allow data jobs to get and set secrets:

```python

class ISecrets:
    """
    Allows for Data Job to store and retrieve secrets.
    Secrets are a solution for securely storing API keys, tokens and passwords necessary to connect to different systems
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def get_secret(self, name: str, default_value: Any = None) -> str:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_all_secrets(self) -> dict:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def set_all_secrets(self, properties: dict):
        pass
```

And here are examples of the usage:

Get a single secret:
```python

def run(job_input):
   my_secret_token = job_input.get_secret("my_secret_key")

```

Get all secrets:
```python

def run(job_input):
   secrets = job_input.get_all_secrets()
   aws_token = secrets['MY_AWS_TOKEN']
   authenticate(aws_token)
```

Set a secrets:
```python

def run(job_input):
   secrets = job_input.get_all_secrets()
   secrets['MY_TOKEN'] = get_new_token()
   job_input.set_all_secrets(secrets)
```

#### Storing/retrieving secrets via the CLI

We are going to introduce a new set of commands for secrets, similar to "vdk properties" where users will be prompted to
set to enter each password.
* Will prompt for the value so it's not printed on the screen
  `vdk secrets --set "my-password"`

* Return the secret value associated with the given key "my-password"
  `vdk secrets --get "my-password"`

* List all secret keys
  `vdk secrets --list`

* List all secret keys and values
  `vdk secrets --list --show-secrets`

* Delete a secret
  `vdk secrets --delete "my-password"`

* Delete all job secrets
  `vdk secrets --delete-all-job-properties`

* Overwrite all job secrets by passing a JSON file
  `vdk secrets --overwrite-all-job-secrets`


Changes to the properties cli command:
* remove the `--set-secret` option
* change the explanation of the command from "store credentials securely" to "store credentials"

## Detailed design


### Configuration changes

We are going to enhance the VDK-CS configuration with an optional Spring Vault Configuration.

```yaml
spring.cloud.vault:
    host: localhost
    port: 8200
    scheme: https
    uri: https://localhost:8200
    connection-timeout: 5000
    read-timeout: 15000
    config:
    token: 19aefa97-cccc-bbbb-aaaa-225940e63d76
```
The configuration can be marked optional as outlined in the
[documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/docs/current/reference/html/#vault.configdata.location.optional)
which allows users who are not interested in using a secret storage, to simply disable this feature.

### Secrets service

We are going to introduce a new Secrets Service class, similar to the existing
[Properties Service](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/tree/main/projects/control-service/projects/pipelines_control_service/src/main/java/com/vmware/taurus/properties)
which handles requests for the Secrets functionality.
We are going to implement changes in VDK-CS API as outlined [API Design]((#api-design)) section.

### Storing secrets in Vault

The secrets for a given data job will be stored under "secret/<team>/<data job>" entry in Vault in JSON object format. So
the secrets for a data job "my-ingestion-job" belonging to the "ingestion" team will be stored under "secret/ingestion/my-ingestion-job".

The maximum size of a secret entry in Vault is 1MiB. Upon calling the store secret method, the VDK-CS will check the size
of the secret object and will return an error if the secret is above the limit. The VDK SDK will interpret this error as
a user error.

### VDK SDK changes

Once the changes in the API have been introduced, we are going to implement the changes in the VDK SDK, e.g.
introduce the secrets related methods in classes, similar to the existing
[job_properties built-in plugin](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/tree/main/projects/vdk-core/src/vdk/internal/builtin_plugins/job_properties)
as outlined [API Design]((#api-design)) section.

### VDK CLI changes

As soon as the changes in the VDK SDK are completed, we can introduce the secrets related commands in the VDK SDK.

<!--
Dig deeper into each component. The section can be as long or as short as necessary.
Consider at least the below topics but you do not need to cover those that are not applicable.

### Capacity Estimation and Constraints
    * Cost of data path: CPU cost per-IO, memory footprint, network footprint.
    * Cost of control plane including cost of APIs, expected timeliness from layers above.
### Availability.
    * For example - is it tolerant to failures, What happens when the service stops working
### Performance.
    * Consider performance of data operations for different types of workloads.
       Consider performance of control operations
    * Consider performance under steady state as well under various pathological scenarios,
       e.g., different failure cases, partitioning, recovery.
    * Performance scalability along different dimensions,
       e.g. #objects, network properties (latency, bandwidth), number of data jobs, processed/ingested data, etc.
### Database data model changes
### Telemetry and monitoring changes (new metrics).
### Configuration changes.
### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy (especially if it might be breaking change).
  * Data migration plan (it needs to be automated or avoided - we should not require user manual actions.)
### Troubleshooting
  * What are possible failure modes.
    * Detection: How can it be detected via metrics?
    * Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    * Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
    * Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why._
### Operability
  * What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the system.
  * What are the expected SLOs (Service Level Objectives).
### Test Plan
  * Unit tests are expected. But are end to end test necessary. Do we need to extend vdk-heartbeat ?
  * Are there changes in CICD necessary
### Dependencies
  * On what services the feature depends on ? Are there new (external) dependencies added?
### Security and Permissions
  How is access control handled?
  * Is encryption in transport supported and how is it implemented?
  * What data is sensitive within these components? How is this data secured?
      * In-transit?
      * At rest?
      * Is it logged?
  * What secrets are needed by the components? How are these secrets secured and attained?
-->
### Performance

To improve data job performance, the secrets will be loaded and cached at the start of the SDK run job - the same
functionality we currently have for properties.

## Alternatives

### "Separate secrets and properties API" vs "Secrets as part of the existing  properties API"

During the initial architecture of this feature we had a discussion on whether the secrets should be part of the existing
properties api/interface. We also reached out to several people whom we consider power users of VDK and everyone agreed
that the secrets should be part of a separate interface as this would eliminate ambiguity and provide clear separation
between the two types of data.

Also storing secrets separately would overall decrease the number of updates of secrets which is generally undesirable
due to Vault's characteristics where frequent updates of secrets could lead to high latency and reduced performance.

### Storing all properties in Vault

We are not going to start storing all properties in vault as secrets as Vault is not designed to handle frequent updates
of the entries stored within.

Our general guidance for properties is that they should be used to store state, e.g. last time stamp or last record of
processed data which could change frequently. We have observed data jobs where users update the properties quite often,
multiple times per single data job run, which is not suitable for secrets stored in Vault.

To that end we are going to keep the two functionalities separate.
