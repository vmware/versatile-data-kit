# VDK Enhancement Proposal (VEP)

A VDK Enhancement Proposal (VEP) is a way to propose,
communicate and coordinate on new efforts for the Versatile Data Kit project.

## Goals

- To help users and contributors understand what is being done and why is it being done this way
  and reduce "tribal knowledge" in our community.
- To help provide a better quality product by having peer review so that potential
  problems and inconsistencies are caught early.
- To help contributors develop their ideas into working solutions faster and easier
  by having a common structure for proposing changes with important topics to cover.

## Quick start for the VEP process:

1. It is good idea to socialize an idea with some other contributors of VDK first. You can send your idea to VDK mailing list, slack, mail, etc.
2. Follow the process outlined in the [VEP template](NNNN-template/README.md)


## Credits

The VEP process, as proposed, is largely based on the [Kubernetes KEP process](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps) which itsef was essentially stolen from the [Rust RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) which itself resembles the [Python PEP process](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/).
