## Summary

<!--
Short summary of the proposal. It will be used as user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a (customer facing) development roadmap.
The tone and content of the `Summary` section should be
useful for a wide audience.

Optional section which defines terms and abbreviations used in the rest of the document.

## Motivation

Versatile Data Kit provides utilities for developing SQL and Python data jobs and deploying them in the cloud. However, the only interface it has for development is the CLI.

As a workload users install their own IDE (PyCharm, for example) locally and configure it with VDK. However, VDK is used by people who do not want to nor need to learn how to work with CLI and install and configure IDEs.
Moreover, many of our users are data scientists who work with big data, and they prefer working with notebooks especially for visualizing and testing. After some interviews we did, and demos we watched, we saw that users switch from IDEs to notebooks in order to see how the data changes (it is easier for them to do it in notebooks since it provides better visualization) and they do some changes on the code there (they are testing small sections which can lead to changes in small sections) which leads to copy pasting the new code from the notebook to the IDE. The whole process of switching from one place to another is inconvenient and tedious. It would be much easier for the users to just open a familiar UI and enter their SQL queries or Python code, without using the CLI and without copy pasting code from one place to another.

Furthermore, currently VDK users need to rerun the whole Data job again every time they do a small change on the code, or a single unit fails. This could be rather time-consuming since the ELT process might be slow. For example, extracting and loading data again only for a small change in transformation.
By integrating VDK with Jupyter we want to make VDK more accessible and  present those users better experience and with their natural choice and make their VDK onboarding process much easier

Jupyter is chosen because it is  very well-known among the data community, it is de-facto the current standard â€“ see:

## Requirements and goals
### Goals

* Users can install new plugin vdk notebook and new command to start local jupyter notebook
  For example user would install jupyter plugin with `pip install vdk-jupyter`
  and then they will be able to start local jupyter instance with `vdk start-jupyter` which will run local instance
  This is simply making it more integrated experience for new users. User can install vdk-jupyter in existing jupyter installation.

* The plugin should be installable in server (centralized) instance of jupyterhub or jupyterlab

Once installed they get following capabilities

#### Development of jobs
##### Option 1: Notebook as a job step
* The Jupyter notebook can be a step in VDK e.g 10_jupyter.ipynb for example. There could be markers for ignoring some cells.
```
 %% non-vdk
 ```
##### Option 2: Cell as a job step
* A cell can be marked as a step using a button. Everything can be done in one notebook or multiple. In this solution all the unmarked cells will be ignored.
##### Option 3: Hybrid
* One cell is one SQL step and one notebook is one python step - mix of option 1 and 2


#### Deployment

* Users can click deploy from within the notebook and the job would be deployed in VDK runtime ("cloud")
* Users should see the status of the deployed jobs
## High-level design

<!--
All the rest sections tell **how** are we solving it?

This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?

Provide a valid UML Component diagram that focuses on the architecture changes
implementing the feature. For more details on how to write UML Component Spec -
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_diagram#External_links.

For every new component on the diagram, explain which goals does it solve.
In this context, a component is any separate software process.

-->


## API design

<!--

Describe the changes and additions to the public API (if there are any).

For all API changes:

Include Swagger URL for HTTP APIs, no matter if the API is RESTful or RPC-like.
PyDoc/Javadoc (or similar) for Python/Java changes.
Explain how does the system handle API violations.
-->


## Detailed design
<!--
Dig deeper into each component. The section can be as long or as short as necessary.
Consider at least the below topics but you do not need to cover those that are not applicable.

### Capacity Estimation and Constraints
    * Cost of data path: CPU cost per-IO, memory footprint, network footprint.
    * Cost of control plane including cost of APIs, expected timeliness from layers above.
### Availability.
    * For example - is it tolerant to failures, What happens when the service stops working
### Performance.
    * Consider performance of data operations for different types of workloads.
       Consider performance of control operations
    * Consider performance under steady state as well under various pathological scenarios,
       e.g., different failure cases, partitioning, recovery.
    * Performance scalability along different dimensions,
       e.g. #objects, network properties (latency, bandwidth), number of data jobs, processed/ingested data, etc.
### Database data model changes
### Telemetry and monitoring changes (new metrics).
### Configuration changes.
### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy (especially if it might be breaking change).
  * Data migration plan (it needs to be automated or avoided - we should not require user manual actions.)
### Troubleshooting
  * What are possible failure modes.
    * Detection: How can it be detected via metrics?
    * Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    * Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
    * Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why._
### Operability
  * What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the system.
  * What are the expected SLOs (Service Level Objectives).
### Test Plan
  * Unit tests are expected. But are end to end test necessary. Do we need to extend vdk-heartbeat ?
  * Are there changes in CICD necessary
### Dependencies
  * On what services the feature depends on ? Are there new (external) dependencies added?
### Security and Permissions
  How is access control handled?
  * Is encryption in transport supported and how is it implemented?
  * What data is sensitive within these components? How is this data secured?
      * In-transit?
      * At rest?
      * Is it logged?
  * What secrets are needed by the components? How are these secrets secured and attained?

## Implementation stories
<!--
Optionally, describe what are the implementation stories (eventually we'd create github issues out of them).
-->

## Alternatives
<!--
Optionally, describe what alternatives has been considered.
Keep it short - if needed link to more detailed research document.
