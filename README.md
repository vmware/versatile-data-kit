# Overview

Versatile Data Kit (VDK) is an open source framework that enables anybody with basic SQL or Python knowledge to create their own data pipelines.

Versatile Data Kit enables Data Engineers to develop, deploy, run and manage Data Jobs. **A Data Job is a data processing workload** and can be written in Python, SQL, or both at the same time. A Data Job enables Data Engineers to implement automated pull ingestion (E in ELT) and batch data transformation (T in ELT) into a database or any type of data storage.

Versatile Data Kit consists of two main components:

* A **Data SDK** provides all tools for the automation of data extraction, transformation, and loading, as well as a plugin framework that allows users to extend the framework according to their specific requirements.
* A **Control Service** allows users to create, deploy, manage and execute Data Jobs in Kubernetes runtime environment.

To help solve common data engineering problems Versatile Data Kit:
* allows ingestion of data from different sources, including CSV files, JSON objects, data provided by REST API services, etc.;
* ensures data applications are packaged, versioned, and deployed correctly while dealing with credentials, retries, reconnects, etc.;
* provides built-in monitoring and smart notification capabilities;
* tracks both code and data modifications and the relations between them, enabling engineers to troubleshoot faster and providing an easy revert to a stable version.

# Installation and Getting Started

#### Install Versatile Data Kit SDK

```bash
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install quickstart-vdk
```
Note that Versatile Data Kit requires Python 3.7+.

See the [Installation page](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/wiki/Installation#install-sdk) for more details.

#### Use

```bash
# see Help to see what you can do
vdk --help
```
