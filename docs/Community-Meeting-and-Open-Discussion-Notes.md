## 11th of January [Watch recording](https://youtu.be/dkqRgo8hoz4)

### Agenda: 
1. VDK’s latest release - Stanislav

## 30th of November [Watch Recording](https://youtu.be/d_JEQZ9cif4)

### Agenda
1. Welcome - Agi
2. Release - Antoni
3. Newest industry DB adoption stats suggest that PostgreSQL gets quite some traction lately. We have recently introduced PostgreSQL embedded support so that for the control service it is a configurational option to choose the database type deployed by default (in case no external data source is set). It could now be either CockroachDB (by default), or PostgreSQL - Iva
4. We have just returned from Data Science Conference Europe 2022, and we’ll talk about our experience there - Vic, Antoni, Dimira

Discussion: 
 - templates for community meetings - do we need one?

 - YT live community meetings

## 28th of September: Creating First Data Job [Watch recording](https://youtu.be/x7h3Mcy61R4) 

### Agenda: 
1. Welcome and intro, if you are new to VDK I encourage you to say hi :) 
2. Quick intro to the project (Agi)
3. Release announcement (Antoni) 
4. GitHub Star History example demo (Agi)
5. Discussion topics: 
 - Two PR reviewers 
 - VDK catchphrase

VDK catchphrase (also anchor text): 

1. unique value
2. clear
3. short and sweet

### Examples: 

* A high-performance observability data pipeline.
* Declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes.
* The easiest way to coordinate your dataflow
* A cloud-native Pipeline resource.
* Always know what to expect from your data.
* Data-Centric Pipelines and Data Versioning
* An orchestration platform for the development, production, and observation of data assets.
* Build powerful pipelines in any programming language.
* Build data pipelines, the easy way
* Machine Learning Pipelines for Kubeflow


I have included data pipelines and other tools that have more than 2000 stars only Airbyte has a longer message:
* Airbyte is an open-source EL(T) platform that helps you replicate your data in your warehouses, lakes and databases.

I think the difference is felt in the readability of the message
So, for this catchphrase it would be nice to come up with something that is #uniquevalue

### Ideas: 
* Building and Managing Data Pipelines with SQL or Python
* Data Pipelines covering full DataOps lifecycle 
* Building and managing your data pipelines with python or SQL on the cloud (or Kubernetes)
* Build, run and manage your data jobs 
* Build, run and manage your data pipelines 
* Develop, run and manage your data pipelines on the cloud
* Automate and abstract the Data and DevOps cycle
* Automate and abstract the Data Journey and the DevOps cycle
* Orchestrate 


A bit more abstract and unclear ideas: 
* Efficient data engineering 
* Enable everyone to focus on work that requires their core skills


(because SQL or python is maybe not our unique value prop)

### Questions: 
* Add cloud or Kubernetes ?
* Data Pipelines OR DataOps pipelines ?

### Helpful questions:
* What do you think is the unique value of VDK 
* How would you google to find this framework? (if you don't know it exists)

"VDK I think rather  has a lot of possibilities in the “T” part - templates (kimball or generic), managed connection plugins enable quality, lineage (when implemented). And also in the abstracting DevOps part - though we need to do more around testing."

Action items: create a form where we can rank the catchphrase

3. Momchil Zhivkov about templates: <br>
Templates are reusable code in the context of data jobs. They are intended to solve a common use case among different users. 
A template is executed through a data job. An example of a common use case is loading data into a data warehouse. 

This presentation will demo:
-	what is a template
-	how does it look
-	the purpose of templates
-	using and developing templates
-	our already existing templates that can be reused

4. Duygu - csv-export <br>
   A new feature was added to the already existing CSV plugin, which allows people to export the result of a SQL query to a CSV file.
5. Toni - VDK release [v0.6](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/releases/tag/v0.6)
6. Open discussion
