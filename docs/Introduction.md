Versatile Data Kit is a data engineering framework that enables data engineers to develop, troubleshoot, deploy, run, and manage data processing workloads (called "Data Job").

# What Problem Does Versatile Data Kit Solve?

In short, we try to make life easier and more efficient for data engineers, data analysts, and data scientists.

The more data we have, the more we can automate business value. However, more data means more cost. To achieve a positive return of investment on data, we need a data system whose value grows faster than its cost. 

Versatile Data Kit aims to optimize the work of data engineers at every step of the engineering cycle. 

1. During development, Versatile Data Kit automates and simplifies a lot of complex transformation and data integration tasks by removing boilerplate, and engineers can focus only on data modeling logic like the ability to ingest data seamlessly, create declarative transformations using only SQL, implement common data patterns like Kimbal or Slowly Changing Dimension types of transformations. 

2. Versatile Data Kit takes care of building, packaging, and scheduling the data applications during deployment. 

3. During operations, Versatile Data Kit monitors and tracks data lineage and code lineage - thus enabling engineers to quickly pinpoint issues (trace code and data changes, monitor data quality), and revert to the latest stable version, etc. 

We live in a diverse ecosystem, and organizations assemble multiple open source components and internal toolings into an end-to-end solution.
And often, multi-tenancy, SSO, access management & governance are necessary for organizations. 
Versatile Data Kit is extremely extensible, enabling users to adopt new technologies and apply internal toolings and practices easily.
