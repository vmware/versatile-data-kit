    Methods in this interface are suitable for ingesting new data into remote data stores.

    The Ingester client provides an easy to use and thread-safe APIs to collect and transfer data to any destination.
    It offers a simple, best effort solution for serializing, packaging, and sending data.

    send_*_for_ingestion provide a way to send data easily form database cursor, API response,
     or any other python iterable collection.

    The client can be configured via configuration overrides, or left on default settings.

    The methods are asynchronous, and data being sent is done in a background threads.
    This library allows buffering of data on the client before sending it.
    You can also configure the frequency at which data is sent .
    You can configure the parallelism in which the data is sent enabling very high throughput of sending data.

    Upon job completion, the job may block until all buffers are flushed and data is sent.
    if there's an error during sending data, the data job will fail upon completion with a corresponding error.

    Destinations method can be installed using plugins
