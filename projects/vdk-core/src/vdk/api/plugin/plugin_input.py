class IIngesterPlugin:
    """
    Interface representing the APIs that can be used when creating Ingester
    Plugins. Plugins implement one of the methods, depending on their needs.
    If more complex processing is required, plugins can be chained
    together.

    The lifecycles of the three methods are as follows:

    ingest_payload() - plugins implementing this method are intended
                       to do actual data ingestion. Versatile Data Kit will
                       call this method when the payload that data engineers
                       have passed is ready to be ingested.

    pre_ingest_process() - plugins implementing this method do not aim at
                        ingesting the payload, rather to do some processing
                        of the payload or the dynamic parameters like target
                        or destination_table before the actual ingestion
                        happens.

    post_ingest_process() - plugins implementing this method aim at doing
                            some metadata processing after the payload is
                            ingested. The main use-case is telemetry data
                            collection.
                            NOTE: This method can be used only by plugins
                            that implement ingest_payload().

            The payload that has been ingested, represented as 0 or many
            dictionary objects.
            NOTE: A read-only parameter. It is not expected to be modified and
            returned.
        :param destination_table: Optional[string]
            (Optional) The name of the table, where the data should be
            ingested into. This argument is optional, and needs to be
            considered only when the name of the destination table is not
            included in the payload itself.
            NOTE: A read-only parameter. It is not expected to be modified and
            returned.
        :param target: Optional[string]
            (Optional) Used to identify where the data should be ingested into.
                Specifies a data source and its destination database.
                The values for this parameter can be in the format
                `<some-data-source_and-db-table>`, or as a URL.
                Example:
                      http://example.com/<some-api>/<data-source_and-db-table>
            This parameter does not need to be used, in case the
            `INGEST_TARGET_DEFAULT` configuration variable is set. This can be
            made by plugins, which may set default value, or it can be
            overwritten by users.

            returned.
        :param collection_id: string
            (Optional) An identifier to indicate that data from different
            method invocations belong to same collection. Defaults to
            "data_job_name|OpID", meaning all method invocations from a data
            job run will belong to the same collection.
            NOTE: A read-only parameter. It is not expected to be modified and
            returned.
        :param metadata: Optional[IngestionMetadata]
            The metadata from the ingestion operation, that plugin developers
            have decided to process further. This metadata can be either an
            IngestionMetadata object (which is effectively a dictionary), or
            None.
            NOTE: A read-only parameter. Whatever modifications are done to
            this object, once returned, it is treated as a new object.
        :param exception: Optional[Exception]
            A caught exception (if any) encountered while ingesting data.
            NOTE: A read-only parameter. Whatever modifications are done to
            this object, once returned, it is treated as a new object.
