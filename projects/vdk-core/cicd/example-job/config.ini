; For format see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron
; The cron expression is evaluated in UTC time.
; If it is time for a new job run and the previous job run hasnâ€™t finished yet, the cron job kills and replaces the currently running job run with a new job run.
; Jobs configured to run more often than once per hour are not supported and their schedule may be overridden by the platform.
; To distribute load evenly, platform team may override the minute you specified.

; See https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files
; This option overrides the full path to the requirements file (relative to the root of the data job directory)
