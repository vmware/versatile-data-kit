## Versatile Data Kit Audit Hook Plugin

Visibility into the actions provides opportunities for test frameworks, logging
frameworks, and security tools to monitor and optionally limit actions taken by the
runtime.
This plugin provides an ability to audit and potentially limit user actions. In
order to have a better understanding of what exactly the job does, we will log all
job actions.

### Usage

To use the plugin, just install it using

```bash
pip install vdk-audit-hook
```
