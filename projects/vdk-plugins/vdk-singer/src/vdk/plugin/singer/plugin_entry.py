# TODO:
# It is very difficult ot install two or more different taps in teh same environment
# They almost certainly use conflicting libraries of singer-python and possibly others.
# This likely means we need a mechanism where those taps would be installed inseparate virtual environments
# possibility is to use pipx or similar tool as we treat singer taps as applications /CLIs and not libraries.
#
# An idea is to add `vdk build` and vkd_build hook in vdk-core.
# It will be called before vdk run (if not called) when running locally
# And it can be called by the Control Service Deployer to install taps in the job docker image.
