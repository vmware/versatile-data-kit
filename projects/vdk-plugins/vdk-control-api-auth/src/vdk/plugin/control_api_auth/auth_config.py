        Keeps local configuration of Control CLI like cached tokens, authorization uris, etc.

        Solves following use-cases:

        One scenario where two different users would like to be able to log in on the same machine.
        People sometimes share a development environment as well. Concrete example is two different user
        using the same Jenkins machine

        Also, another use-case is if you want to connect to two different Control Services with different authentication.
        For example, during development, a Demo Control Service works with staging provider but in the
        deployment in production works with Production. So in order to switch you need to re-login every time.
        But now you can just switch tabs (with different environment variables set)
