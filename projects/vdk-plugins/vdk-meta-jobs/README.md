#### Note about the CICD:

.plugin-ci.yaml is needed only for plugins part of [Versatile Data Kit Plugin repo](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/tree/main/projects/vdk-plugins).

The CI/CD is separated in two stages, a build stage and a release stage.
The build stage is made up of a few jobs, all which inherit from the same
job configuration and only differ in the Python version they use (3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10).
They run according to rules, which are ordered in a way such that changes to a
plugin's directory trigger the plugin CI, but changes to a different plugin does not.
