/**
 * In order to provide a complex filtering and searching functionality as well as data querying to
 * different source (K8s, Database) we need to abstract the logic for this into separate classes and
 * Strategy pattern seems like a good option. When someone ask for filtering it passes which field
 * want to manipulate by and this is the key of the key-value pair of the strategy pattern
 *
 * <p>When a new field needs to be added the steps are (currently) two: 1. Add new enum entry in
 * {@link JobFieldStrategyBy} with the field name 2. Create a class which extends this abstract
 * class and is annotated by @Component
 *
 * <p>Then, Spring will detect automatically that there is new {@link FieldStrategy} instance and it
 * will be included in the field manipulation mechanism
