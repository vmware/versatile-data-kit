### Ingress resource parameters
ingress:
  ## Configure ingress resource to expose the service outside of K8s. The ingress resource will serve as reverse proxy,
  ## load balancer, terminate SSL connections and support SNI to route HTTP traffic to the local service.
  ## F.e. it could aid with the following scenario:
  ##   - HTTP/HTTPS client redirects
  ##   - Rewrite rules: rewrite URI based on regex match (see annotations document for examples)
  ##   - Single entrypoint to terminate SSL connections (ingress.tls_secret is required to support HTTPS)
  ##
  ## More in-depth documentation is available here:
  ##   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/
  ##
  ## Ingress controller should already be available on the cluster. Unlike some other controllers, it is deployed
  ## separately. Chances are there is one already present.
  enabled: false
  ## Add custom annotations to the ingress resource. Objects below will update the ingress runtime configuration.
  ## Supported annotations: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/
  annotations: {}
  # kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  ## Configure hostname to use in named-based virtual host.
  host:
  ## URI path/endpoint to the service
  ## This should be unique path to instruct the ingress controller which path is served by the downstream service.
  ## Defaults to '/'
  ## This allows the service to co-exist and share the same hostname with other services.
  path: ""
  ## Provide existing secret which holds TLS certificate/key.
  ## This is will instruct the ingress controller to use specific TLS certificate on this ingress resource. By default,
  ## we use community Nginx controller which supports SNI, thus a signle IP could terminate all connections.
  ## https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/
  tls_secret: ""

# Embedded server settings
server:
   ## Max Http Header Size - defaults to 8KB
   maxHttpHeaderSize: 8KB

credentials:
   ## Configuration for automatic management of Data Job Credentials and Users for connecting to data plane (databases usually).
   ## Then they can managed by the SRE operation team which they can do credential rotations, invalidation, etc.
   ## If enabled, each data job is automatically provisioned principal (users) and credentials (e.g passwords, keys).
   ## And upon Cloud execution they are injected into the data job and picked up by the SDK.
   ## THe following types are possible
   ## * EMPTY - no principal nor credentials are automatically provisioned. Thus effectively disables the feature. User needs to manually provision and configure credentials as job secrets.
   ## * KERBEROS - when set kerberos user and keytab file are created for each data job. kerberosXXX options below are required then.
   repository: "EMPTY"

   ## Credentials principal pattern. It must have "%(data_job)" in the pattern which will be replaced by the name of the data job..
   ## Different patterns can be given to different data-pipelines deployments that share the same authentication repository (for example same Kerberos KDC).
   ## This way they won't interfere with each other.
   ## Generally should be left as default. It should be used only if multiple deployments of Versatile Data Kit that use same authentication repository.
   ## The default principal name in VDK must be the same as this one.
   ## Or when running locally it needs to overridden (environmental variable VDK_KEYTAB_PRINCIPAL)
   ## During cloud runs that variable is set automatically.
   principalPattern: "pa__view_%(data_job)"

### WebHooks configuration

webHooks:
   ## Webhooks that will delegate postCreate and postDelete actions to the devops team operating the Versatile Data Kit service.
   ## It can be configured during installation and whenever postCreate and postDelete actions need to be taken Versatile Data Kit API will call it
   ##
   ## HTTP POST request to <webhook address>/<requested_http_path> with body JSON content:
   ##
   ## * requester_user_id - this is retrieved from the Oauth2 token claims (see jwtClaimUsername configuration)
   ## * requested_resource_team - team that the job belongs to.
   ## * requested_resource_name - this is always "data-job"
   ## * requested_resource_id - the data job name
   ## * requested_http_path - The HTTP Path of the REST API request being invoked.
   ##                         For Create Job: it will be /data-jobs/for-team/{team-name}/jobs.
   ##                         For Delete Job: it will be /data-jobs/for-team/{team-name}/jobs/{job-name}.
   ##                         Example: /data-jobs/for-team/taurus/jobs/example.
   ## * requested_http_verb - The HTTP verb of the REST API request being invoked
   ##                         For Create Job: it will be POST.
   ##                         For Delete Job: it will be DELETE.
   ## Complete example:
   ### Post Delete WebHook:
   ### HTTP POST: https://webhook.com/data-jobs/for-team/taurus/jobs/example
   ### {
   ###    requester_user_id: auserov,
   ###    requested_resource_team: taurus,
   ###    requested_resource_name: data-job,
   ###    requested_resource_id: example,
   ###    requested_http_path: /data-jobs/for-team/taurus/jobs/example,
   ###    requested_http_verb: DELETE
   ###  }

   ###    requested_http_path: /data-jobs/for-team/taurus/jobs,
   ###    requested_http_verb: POST
   ###  }
   ###
   ## Expected return results(for both the request types):
   ##    2xx means the web Hook Operation is successful and the job is created/deleted
   ##    4xx or 5xx the job is not created/deleted
   ## 4xx response content is shown to end user as an error message.
   ## 5xx responses will be retried (number of retries is based on configuration, defaults to 3)

      ## Webhook that will delegate authorization decisions.
      ## It can be configured during   installation and whenever authorization decision needs to be taken Versatile Data Kit API will call it
      ##
      ## HTTP POST request to webhook address with body JSON content:
      ##
      ## * requester_user_id - this is retrieved from the Oauth2 token claims (see jwtClaimUsername configuration)
      ## * requested_resource_team - team that the job belongs to configured during its creation or passed to create job request. Otherwise if job does not exists, it's empty.

                  <p>
                  WHAT HAPPENED: The Data Job has been delayed from its expected execution schedule.<br>
                  WHY IT HAPPENED: Possible reason for this is that the Data Job execution is taking so long that the next scheduled execution could not start in time. Or, there could be a platform error preventing the Data Job execution from starting.<br>
                  CONSEQUENCES: Your Data Job execution did not start in time, or, potentially, did not start at all.<br>
                  COUNTERMEASURES: Please review the executions of your latest data job runs and if they take longer than expected, increase the scheduled interval by modifying the schedule_cron property or increase the notification_delay_period_minutes property in the config.ini file and redeploy the Data Job.

dataJob:
  executions:
    ## These values expose configuration properties for the execution api
    ## The execution API helps you collect information about previous
    ## data job executions, or manually start a job execution. Stored data job
    ## execution information will naturally increase over time. This is why we
    ## are providing a way to clean old information about data job executions through
    ## the following properties:
    ##
    ## maximumExecutionsToStore - The maximum amount of executions per data job to keep. If data
    ##                            job executions exceed this number, the older executions are deleted.
    ##
    ## executionsTtlSeconds - Total time to live per data job execution. Data job executions older than ttlSeconds
    ##              specified also get deleted.
    ##
    cleanupTask:
      ## maximum number of data job executions to store in the database / default is 100.
      maximumExecutionsToStore: "100"
      ## maximum time to live seconds for each execution / default is 14 days.
      executionsTtlSeconds: "1209600"
    logsUrl:
      ## This template will be used for building of logs URL for each data job execution returned by API.
      ## Supported variables which will be replaced in the template with the particular execution values:
      ## {{execution_id}}, {{job_name}}, {{op_id}}, {{start_time}} and {{end_time}}
      ## Example: "https://log-insight-url/li/query/stream?query=%C2%A7%C2%A7%C2%A7AND%C2%A7%C2%A7%C2%A7%C2%
      ## A7{{start_time}}%C2%A7{{end_time}}%C2%A7true%C2%A7COUNT%C2%A7text:CONTAINS:{{execution_id}}*"
      urlTemplate: ""
      ## This variable is used to determine the format of execution.startTime
      ## and execution.endTime used in the template (datajobs.executions.logsUrl.template).
      ## Supported options: iso (https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) and unix (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
      ## If left blank, defaults to unix.
