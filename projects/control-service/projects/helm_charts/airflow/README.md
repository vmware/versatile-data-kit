This is demo installation of airflow for Taurus team using bitnami airflow helm chart

For some reason airflow git syncer fail with git merges so make sure to use rebase strategy for pushing on master
or use fast-forward merge (e.g in Gitlab under Settings -> General -> Merge Requests -> select "Fast-forward merge".)
