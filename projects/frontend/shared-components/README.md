# VDK Shared Components library

This project implements common UI functionality that is project agnostic.
The hope with having them in a separate directory is that other projects might leverage them.
Within this project there is also a project(documentation-ui) for bootstrapping the individual screens for development and testing purposes.

## Running

Shared UI Components library is build and delivered as an Angular Library that is consumable via
the NPMJS repository.
See the `README.md` files in individual directories under `projects` for specific instructions.
