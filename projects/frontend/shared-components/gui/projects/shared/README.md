# VDK Shared Components Library

This library provides UI components/screens that could be consumed by any angular project.
Within this open source project they are consumed in the data-pipelines project.

## Code scaffolding


Run `ng generate component component-name --project shared` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project shared`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project shared` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Lint

Run `ng lint shared` to lint the project.

## Build

Run `ng build shared` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test shared` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
