# Bugs

## Where to Find Known Issues
Review the [list of existing issues](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.

## Reporting New Issues
To report a bug, [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/issues). Include steps to replicate the bug in the issue description.

## Security Bugs
If you believe you have found a security bug, [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/issues) and reach out to us first using any method in the [Contact Us](#contact-us) section.

# Propose a Change
Before proposing a feature or change, consider the impact of this change. Does it only serve your needs, or does it serve the broader community's needs?

For substantial features or changes, submitting your design is valuable.

To submit a change:
1. Create a PR in Github.
2. Follow the [VDK Enhancement Proposal (VEP)](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/tree/main/specs) template.
3. Add your proposal as markdown in the [/specs](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/blob/main/specs) directory.

Reviews, feedback, and approvals are documented in the PR.

Reach out to the community through Slack or e-mail in the [Contact Us](#contact-us) section to discuss your idea. We are happy to help.

# Your First Pull Request
If this is your first PR, take a look at this video series to get you started:
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Take a look at our list of [good first issues](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/labels/good%20first%20issue). These issues are a great place to start.

If you see an issue that you would like to work on, leave a comment in the issue to let people know you are interested.

## Submit and merge a change
Before submitting your first PR, please review our general guidelines in [How to prepare a new PR](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/wiki/How-to-prepare-a-new-PR).

## Pull Request Checklist
Before submitting your pull request, review the following:
- Check if your code changes pass both code linting checks and unit tests.
- Ensure your commit messages are descriptive. Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message. See [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for guidelines on syntax formatting.
- Check the commit and commit messages to ensure they are free from spelling and grammar errors.
- Use clear commit titles and commit descriptions for generating changelog release notes.

## Submit a pull request
- All changes must be submitted to the main branch using pull requests.
- Any change must go on a feature branch or on a fork.
- Pipeline must pass before merging.
- Code commits must be broken down into small self-contained units.
- Commit messages must follow the template in [git-commit-template.txt](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/blob/main/support/git-commit-template.txt). See [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit) as a guideline to writing commit messages.
- The change must abide by the [Versatile Data Kit Coding Standard](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/wiki/Coding-Standard).
- Each change is a subject to two code reviews and approvals before it is merged.

We prefer to maintain a straight branch history by rebasing before merging. Fast-forward merges should not create merge conflicts.

# Development Workflow
A typical development workflow has the following process:
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work, naming your branch according to our naming convention. For example, `person/<github-username>/<feature-name>`.
- Make commits in logical units.
- Use clear commit titles and commit descriptions.
- Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork.
- Create a pull request from commit.

We follow the GitHub workflow. See [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for more information.

**Note**: Use forks only for examples and documentation contributions.
  Currently we accept contribution from forks only for examples and documentation changes until PR 854 is fixed. Until then, please request write privileges and create a branch in the main repository.

# Coding Standard
