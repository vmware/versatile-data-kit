- Check that you can open the MyBinder tied to the Workshop

## Goals
- Why data science models fail to be moved to production​
- (Primary) Empower Data Scientists to create production-ready models & analysis​
- (Secondary) Increase the ability of data practitioners to be more effective in their day-to-day development and operations​
- Provide tools to take responsibility of end-to-end process from data extraction to deploying scheduled predictive model in self-service manner​

## Agenda
- Introduction to VDK - [vdk-for-open-fest-workshop.pdf](https://github.com/vmware/versatile-data-kit/files/9791829/vdk-for-open-fest-workshop.pdf)
- VDK in practice: workshop

## Workshop: COVID vs Candle No Scent Complaints
Ispired by a Twitter post, we will investigate whether there is a connection between COVID cases in the US and increased "no scent" complaints for Yankee candles on Amazon.
We will go through the whole data science workflow from obtaining the data, cleaning it, doing a correlation analysis, and building a data-driven application that is being updated regularly. This will be achieved with minimal additional effort compared to running the analysis in POC.
