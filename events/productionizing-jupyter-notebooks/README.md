## Agenda
- Discuss strategies for productionizing Jupyter Notebooks.
- Showcase hands-on examples of these challenges in the Jupyter UI.

## Purpose
The purpose of this scenario is to demonstrate how to operationalize Jupyter notebooks using the Versatile Data Kit (VDK) Jupyter integration.
By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to:
* Create a data job with VDK within a Jupyter notebook.
* Write a data workflow in a notebook and make it ready to be put in a production environment.

## Background
### Objective:
The tutorial walks you through standard ETL process retrieve,
clean, transform, load data in a notebook environment and addresses
the challenges linked to making that notebook ready for production.


### Versatile Data Kit Jupyter Integration
For detailed instructions on working with VDK, please refer to the guide from the provided [link](../../projects/vdk-plugins/vdk-jupyter/getting-started.ipynb).

## Exercises
The tutorial-job directory contains the ready-to-use code. Make sure to explore it as it will provide hands-on experience with the objectives and VDK Jupyter integration discussed in this guide.

## Lessons Learned
**Congratulations! 🎉**

Throughout this scenario, you've:
* Explored the capabilities of the VDK Jupyter integration.
* Retrieved, cleaned, and processed data using Jupyter and VDK tools.
* Understood the process of ingesting data through VDK within a Jupyter environment.
* Understood the process of making notebooks ready for production with VDK.
