So what if we can create named plugins and register them in vdk_start again.
We should also be able to pass the configuration values like this.
For example OraclePlugin("oracle1", config)
And when creating the env, conf variables in the plugins itself to use the the plugin name that was passed.
So instead of vdk_oracle_password we should get it to vdk_oracle1_password.

We should get vdk_<plugin_class_name>_password to vdk_<plugin_name>_password.

In this way we will be able to register it at the right time in vdk_configure with different names and we will be able to use the same 
configuration builder. 
This will lead to no changes in the current vdk-core. 
The default way should be like this-> if no name is gives the plugin uses  "oracle" "impala", etc.
